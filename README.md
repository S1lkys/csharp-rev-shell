This Executes a semi-interactive reverse shell. Its nothing special and shoudl be obfuscated before using it.
Use at your own risk. Im not responsible for shit you're doing :) 

* created a Python script that acts as a netcat server and listens for incoming connections from clients.
* implemented a simple XOR encryption and decryption algorithm in the Python script to secure the network communications between the server and the client.
* created a C# reverse shell that connects to the Python server and establishes a command shell over the network.
* implemented a simple XOR encryption and decryption algorithm in the C# reverse shell to secure the network communications between the client and the server.
* modified the Python script and the C# reverse shell to communicate with each other using the XOR encryption and decryption algorithm.

* [Patched a few Bugs]
